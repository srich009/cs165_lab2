--------------------


sub_401080 = authentification 

	this is where the user will input the username and password
	after they enter the input it moves to loc_4010D5
	
	the last instruction in this group is a jump if not zero to loc_4010F5
	this circles back to loc_4010D5 if zero or continues towards input validation
	by changing the jump instruction it can skip over this and get to where the printing of the flag is.
	the part which has the last check before printing is loc_40112B
	
	ORIGINAL
	
	loc_4010D5:
	mov     dl, [eax]
	cmp     dl, [ecx]
	jnz     short loc_4010F5
	
	MODIFIED:
	
	loc_4010D5:
	mov     dl, [eax]
	cmp     dl, [ecx]
	jmp     short loc_40112B	
		
		
	the next part is loc_40112B this tests eax and if it is zero it jumps to loc_401156.
	loc_401156 is the part which prints out the incorrect password message.
	by replacing jnz loc_401156 with a nop it will instead go to the part which prints the flag.
